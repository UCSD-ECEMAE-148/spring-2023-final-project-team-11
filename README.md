# Final Project Overview 
As a team, we wanted to build up from the GPS assignment we had at the beginning of the spring 2023 quarter. So we wanted to use DonkeyCar to create a predefined waypoint path that we wanted our car to follow while also doing sign detection. Depending on what sign out Robocar saw it would either turn left (_left.png), right (_right.png) or stop (_park.png). At first we wanted to use YOLO for the sign detection but after the advisement of our TA, we used OpenCV instead.
